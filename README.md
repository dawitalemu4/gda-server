# GDA-server

This API was built with [**Django**](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [**Django Rest Framework**](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/), and [**GraphQL**](https://graphql.org/) [**(Graphene)**](https://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/) connected to a PostgreSQL database for an e-commerce site that sells and displays traditional ethiopian clothing called [Genet's Designs and Alterations](https://genetdesigns.vercel.app), a small business run by a tailor named Genet Bekele.

# GraphQL Examples

Our use case for GraphQL was to easily filter through sale_/sold_clothes data using the different filter options defined in our models, which is the `schema.py`. This data is then sent to our Remix.js (React) frontend.

    CATEGORIES = [
        ("CT", "Clothing, Top"),
        ("CB", "Clothing, Bottom"),
        ("CO", "Clothing, Other"),
        ...
    ]
    SIZES = [
        ("XXS", "Extra Extra Small"),
        ("XS", "Extra Small"),
        ("S", "Small"),
        ...
    ]
    GENDERS = [
        ("M", "Male"),
        ("F", "Female"),
        ("U", "Unisex")
    ]

# Notes

To start the Django live server, use the `local` branch and run `python manage.py runserver`.

The `main` and `dev` branches are tweaked for Vercel's serverless deployment and don't work locally.
